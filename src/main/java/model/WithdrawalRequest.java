/**
 * Entity class representing a Withdrawal Request submitted by a student.
 * 
 * <p>Students can request to withdraw from an internship application at any stage,
 * including after accepting a placement. All withdrawal requests must be reviewed
 * and approved by career center staff before taking effect.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Key Business Rules:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Withdrawal requests can be submitted before or after placement confirmation</li>
 *   <li>All requests must be approved by career center staff</li>
 *   <li>Approved withdrawals release the internship slot</li>
 *   <li>Student must provide a reason for withdrawal</li>
 *   <li>Staff can approve or reject with comments</li>
 *   <li>Once processed (approved/rejected), decision is final</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Status Flow:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * PENDING → APPROVED (by career center staff) → Slot released, application withdrawn
 *        → REJECTED (by career center staff) → Application remains active
 * </pre>
