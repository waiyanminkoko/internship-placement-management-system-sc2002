/**
 * Entity class representing an Application for an internship by a student.
 * 
 * <p>Applications track the lifecycle of a student's request to join an internship
 * opportunity, from initial submission through approval or rejection by the
 * company representative, and potential placement acceptance by the student.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Key Business Rules:</b></p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>All applications start with PENDING status</li>
 *   <li>Company representatives can approve (→ SUCCESSFUL) or reject (→ UNSUCCESSFUL)</li>
 *   <li>Students can only accept placement for SUCCESSFUL applications</li>
 *   <li>Maximum 3 applications per student at any time</li>
 *   <li>Accepting one placement automatically withdraws all other applications</li>
 *   <li>Applications can be withdrawn by student (requires staff approval)</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Status Flow:</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * PENDING → SUCCESSFUL (approved by company) → Placement Accepted
 *        → UNSUCCESSFUL (rejected by company)
 *        → WITHDRAWN (student request or automatic)
 * </pre>
